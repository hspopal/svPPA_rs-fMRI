# svPPA_rs-fMRI

These scripts were used to analyze resting-state functional connectivity data of young health adults, older adults, and svPPA patients. The "indiv_subj_corrs_z*.m" files import and organize data for each group of subjects. The input for this script should be a multi-row dataset with 1-D vector for the ROI to ROI a-score correlations for each subject. The "grpmat_DAN_VS_DMN_z.m" file will run these preliminary scripts and complete all ROI to ROI correlations and make relevant figures.
